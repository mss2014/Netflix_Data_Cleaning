# Netflix TV Shows and Movies Data Cleaning and Preprocessing Task

## Overview
This project involves cleaning and organizing Netflix's TV shows and movies dataset using Microsoft Excel. The goal is to prepare the dataset for analysis and visualization by removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and optimizing the data structure.

## Features
- Identifying and handling missing data in columns like `country`, `rating`, `director`, etc.
- Standardizing column formats (e.g., converting `date_added` to DD-MM-YYYY).
- Extracting insights, such as `year_added` and `month_added`, from the `date_added` column.
- Removing duplicate entries.
- Applying conditional formatting to highlight specific data trends (e.g., ratings or duration types).
- Exporting the cleaned dataset for further analysis.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Excel 2016 or later recommended)

## Files Included
- `Netflix_title.csv`: The raw dataset file.
- `Netflix_Cleaned_Data.csv`: The cleaned dataset file.
- `README.md`: This summary file.

## Steps for Cleaning
1. Open the `Netflix_Raw_Data.xlsx` file in Excel.
2. Use the **Sort & Filter** feature to identify and remove duplicate rows.
3. Apply **Data Validation** to handle missing values (e.g., replace blanks with "Unknown").
4. Format the `date_added` column using the **Date** formatting option.
5. Format the Column Headers by using Bold and font option.
6. Save the cleaned data as `Netflix_Cleaned_Data.xlsx`.

## Usage
1. Open the `Netflix_Cleaned_Data.xlsx` file in Excel.
2. Use filters or pivot tables to analyze data trends.
3. Share the cleaned dataset for visualization in tools like Power BI or Tableau.
